            <h1>Sentence</h1>
                <p>A sentence is a collection of words that convey sense or meaning and is formed according to the logic of grammar.</p>
		<p>Clear, short sentences are preferable, and more effective, than long, complex ones.</p><br id="2">

            <h1>Parts of a Sentence</h1>
                <p>The simplest sentence consists only of a noun, a naming word, and a verb or action word.</p><br>
		<p>For example, in the sentence “Peter jumped”, Peter is the noun and jumped is the verb.</p><br id="3">

	    <h1>Pronouns</h1>
		<p>Peter is the proper noun in the sentence above but can be replaced in following sentences by the pronoun he.</p>
		<p>A pronoun is a word that can be used instead of a noun when a noun has already been mentioned.</p>
		<p>Other pronouns are she, we, they and it.</p><br id="4">

            <h1>Subject and Object Noun</h1>
                <p>Most sentences have a subject noun and an object noun.</p><br>
		<p>For example, consider the sentence “Blake ran towards the court”.</p>
		<p>Blake is the subject noun (a person or thing performing the action of running),</p>
		<p>and the court is the object noun (a person or thing towards which the action is directed).</p>
		<p>Clear, short sentences are preferable, and more effective, than long, complex ones.</p><br id="5">

            <h1>Adjectives</h1>
                <p>An adjective describes a noun and usually comes before it.</p>
		<p>When two adjectives are used to describe one noun, they are set a part with the use of a comma. </p><br>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<p>The quick athlete sprinted to the finish line.</p>
		<p>The quick, tall athlete sprinted to the finish line.</p><br id="6">


            <h1>Adverbs</h1>
                <p>Adverbs describe verbs. The adverb should always follow the verb.</p><br>
		<p>For example:<p>
		<p>Stephen finished his homeworks quickly.</p>
		<p>Victor fixed the jigsaw puzzle carefully.</p><br id="7">


            <h1>Tense</h1>
                <p>Verbs, or action words, are expressed in tenses; past, present or future.</p>
		<p>The tense of a verb is its setting in time.</p><br>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<p>Russel jogged (past tense)</p>
		<p>Russel jogs (present tense)</p>
		<p>Russel will jog (future tense)</p><br id="8">

            <h1>Incorrect Use of Tense</h1>
                <p>There are also other tenses not covered here.</p>
		<p>An important point is to be consistent in your use of tense.</p>
		<p>Choose whether you are telling an event in the past, present or future and then be consistent in the use of that tense until there is a good reason for changing.</p>
		<p>The incorrect use of tenses is one of the most common mistakes of grammar.</p><br>
		<p>For example, consider the following sentence:</p>
		<p>“Julian went to the field and play frisbee”.</p>
		<p>The verb went is in the past tense but play is in the present tense.</p><br>
		<p>The correct tensing of the sentence should be:</p>
		<p>“Julian went to the field and played frisbee”.</p><br>
