        <article id="1">
            <h1>Addition</h1>
                <p> Addition is the term used to describe adding two or more numbers together.</p>
		<p>The plus sign ‘+‘ is used to denote an addition: 2 + 2.</p>
		<p>The + can be used multiple times as required: 2 + 2 + 2.</p>
		<p>For longer lists of numbers it is usually easier to write the numbers in a column and preform the calculation at the bottom.</p>
		<p>It doesn’t matter in which order you add a group of numbers together as the answer will always be the same:</p>
		<p>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 gives the same answer (10) as 4 + 2 + 1 + 3</p>
		<p>Adding 0 to any number makes no difference 2 + 0 = 2.</p>
		<p>Once you can count to ten you can usually quickly perform additions up to ten.</p><br>
		<p>For example, if you're given two piles of cards, one pile containing 4 cards and the other containing 3 cards, you can count all the cards and come up with the answer: 7.</p><br id="2">

	    <h1>Subtraction</h1>
                <p> Subtraction is the term used to describe taking away one or more numbers from another.</p>
		<p>Subtraction is also commonly used to find the difference between two numbers.</p>
		<p>Subtraction is the opposite to addition.</p>
		<p>The minus sign ‘-‘ is used to denote a subtraction calculation, 4 - 2 = 2.</p>
		<p>The '-' sign can be used multiple times as required, 8 - 2 - 2 = 4, for example; however, although this calculation is correct it is often simpler to add together multiple numbers for subtraction.</p>
		<p>8 - 2 - 2 can be simplified to 8 - 4 (the two 2s were added together to give 4 which is then subtracted from the 8).  8 - 2 - 2 and 8 - 4 both equal 4.</p>
		<p>When subtracting, unlike addition, the order of numbers does matter – the first number is the number you are subtracting from, subsequent numbers can be in any order.</p><br>
		<p>10-5 is different to 5-10</p><br>
		<p>10-5 = 5 whereas 5-10 = -5</p><br>
		<p>When numbers of equal value are subtracted from each other the result is always 0.  19-19 = 0</p>
		<p>When subtracting 0 from any number the number remains unchanged. 19-0 = 19</p><br>
		<p>Simple subtraction can be easily learned in the same way as addition, by counting:</p><br>
		<p>If Phoebe has 9 sweets and Luke has 5 sweets what is the difference?</p>
		<p>Starting with the smaller number (5) and count up to the larger number (9).</p>
		<p>6 (1), 7 (2),  8 (3),  9 (4).</p>
		<p>Phoebe has 4 more sweets than Luke, the difference in sweets is 4.</p>
		<p>So: 9 - 5 = 4.</p><br id="3">

	    <h1>Multiplication</h1>
                <p>Multiplication is the repeated addition of a number.</p>
		<p>When you ‘multiply’ or ‘times’ a number you add it to itself a number of times, for example 3 multiplied by 3 is the same as saying 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.</p>
		<p>Multiplication however is a quicker way of adding the same number many times 3 × 3 = 9.</p>
		<p>This calculation is the same as saying, if I have 3 lots of 3 widgets, how many widgets do I have in total?</p><br>

		<p>Basic Rules of Multiplication:</p>
		<p>Any number multiplied by 0 is 0.  200 × 0 = 0</p>
		<p>Any number multiplied by 1 stays the same.  200 × 1 = 200.</p>
		<p>When a whole number is multiplied by 10 we can simply add a 0 to the end (there is one zero in 10).  200 × 10 = 2000.</p>
		<p>When multiplying by 100 we add two zeros to the end, by a thousand we add three zeros to the end and so on.  4 × 2000 for example is 4 × 2 = 8 plus 3 zeros: 8000.</p><br id="4">

		<h1>Division</h1>
                <p>Division is the opposite of multiplication in mathematics.</p>
		<p>Division allows us to divide or 'share' numbers to find an answer.</p>
		<p>Multiplication gives us a quick way of doing multiple additions and division gives us a quick way of doing multiple subtractions.</p>
		<p>Division is often considered the hardest of the four main arithmetic functions, remember all division calculations can easily be carried out on a calculator.</p>
		<p>When you think about division think about sharing a number equally by the number of times the sum says. For example 10 sweets divided by 2 children = 5 sweets each.</p>
		<p>When you divide 0 by another number the answer is always 0. For example: 0 ÷ 4 = 0.</p>
		<p>When you divide a number by 0 you are not dividing at all. 7 ÷ 0 is not possible.</p>
		<p>When you divide by 1 the answer is the same as the number you were dividing.  5 ÷ 1 = 5.</p>
		<p>Any number divided by the same number is 1. 26 ÷ 26 = 1.</p>
		<p>Numbers must be divided in the correct order. 10 ÷ 2 = 5 whereas 2 ÷ 10 = 0.2.</p>
		<p>Ten pizzas divided by two children is very different to 2 pizzas divided by 10 children.</p><br>
		<p>If Paul has 9 boxes of pizzas and eats 3 boxes a day how many days are there before it runs out?</p><br>
		<p>We can work this problem out by doing a series of subtractions, or by counting backwards in steps of 3.</p><br>
		<p>On day 1 Paul starts with 9 boxes and ends with 6 boxes. 9 - 3 = 6</p>
		<p>On day 2 Paul starts with 6 boxes and ends with 3 boxes. 6 - 3 = 3</p>
		<p>On day 3 Paul starts with 3 boxes and ends with 0 boxes. 3 - 3 = 0</p><br>
		<p>Paul runs out of fuel on day 3. 
		<p>A quicker way of preforming this sum would be to divide 9 by 3.  9 ÷ 3 = 3. That is, how many times does 3 go into 9.</p><br>
